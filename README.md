### This is a solution to the
# [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)
### challenge.
This branch does not require a .env file to function normally, but will lose all saved URLs if the server restarts / crashes. For a version of this project that uses MongoDB, and therefore does not face these problems, see the [mongodb branch](https://github.com/AremTheEnigma/url-shortener/tree/url-shortener-using-mongodb).
