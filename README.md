This is a solution to the
# [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)
challenge.
This repository does not include an .env file, if you wish to host your own instance of this, you will need to define your own PORT and MONGO_URI variables in your own .env file.
This project was tested with PORT=3000.
In order for this to work, you *will* need a (MONGO_URI)[https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/].
